Response: Page 128 of the document discusses multiclass classification and how it differs from binary classification. It also explains two main strategies for multiclass classification using multiple binary classifiers:

**One-vs-All (OvA):**

* Trains N binary classifiers, one for each class (e.g., a 0-detector, a 1-detector, a 2-detector, etc.).
* When classifying an image, the score from each classifier is obtained, and the class with the highest score is chosen as the prediction. 

**One-vs-One (OvO):**

* Trains N * (N-1) / 2 binary classifiers for every pair of digits (e.g., a classifier for 0s vs. 1s, another for 0s vs. 2s, and so on).
* When classifying an image, all the classifiers are run, and the class with the most "wins" (i.e., more correct predictions) is chosen as the prediction.

The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are then discussed. Scikit-Learn automatically implements OvA for most multiclass classification tasks, except for SVM classifiers where it uses OvO.

Finally, the page provides an example of how to use Scikit-Learn's OneVsOneClassifier class to create a multiclass classifier using the OvO strategy.

>> ok this is good, now explain to me, what  are the topics covered in page 223
Response: Page 223 of the PDF discusses **Out-of-Bag Evaluation** in the context of bagging ensembles. 

Here's a breakdown of the key points covered:

* **How Bagging Works:**  The BaggingClassifier in Scikit-Learn samples m training instances (the same size as the original training set) with replacement. This means that roughly 63% of the training instances are used for each predictor, while the remaining 37% are left out, called **out-of-bag (oob)** instances.  These oob instances are different for each predictor in the ensemble.
* **OOB Evaluation:**  Since the predictors haven't seen these oob instances during training, they can be used to evaluate the ensemble's performance without needing a separate validation set. The average performance across all predictors on their respective oob instances provides an estimate of the ensemble's generalization error.
* **How to Enable OOB Evaluation:**  In Scikit-Learn, setting `oob_score=True` when creating a `BaggingClassifier` automatically performs out-of-bag evaluation and makes the results accessible through the `oob_score_` attribute.

Essentially, OOB evaluation is a clever way to get an estimate of how well a bagging ensemble will generalize without needing to hold out a portion of the training data for validation. This is a significant advantage because it allows you to use the entire dataset for training.
