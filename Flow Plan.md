Given your updated requirement, where **cached context** may not be the ideal solution for documents over 200 pages, we can revise the flow to **leave cached context as an optional feature**. For larger documents, we’ll rely on a more scalable solution for retrieving and processing information dynamically. Below is the updated and more flexible flow that addresses both options — with and without cached context — for different document sizes.

---

## **1. File Upload**

### **Frontend**  
1. **User Interaction:**  
   - User uploads a file via a form and optionally provides metadata (e.g., description, category tags).  
2. **API Call:**  
   - File and metadata are sent to the `/upload_document` API endpoint via a POST request.  

---

### **Backend Process**  

#### **a. Validation**  
- Validate the file:
  - **File Type:** Ensure the file format is accepted (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
  - **File Size:** Ensure it’s within limits (e.g., 200 MB).
  - **Virus Scan:** Use an antivirus service to scan the file for security.

#### **b. Storage in Object Storage**  
- Store the uploaded file in an **object storage system** (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
  - Generate a **unique identifier (document_id)** for the file.
  - Store the file in specific storage locations based on file type:
    - **Business Rule Sets:** `/business_rules/`
    - **Data Files:** `/data_files/`

#### **c. Database Entry**  
- Record the file's metadata in the database:
  - **`uploaded_ruleset` Table:** For business rule sets.
    - `document_id`, `user_id`, `filename`, `description`, `file_location`, `upload_timestamp`
  - **`uploaded_data` Table:** For data files.
    - `document_id`, `user_id`, `filename`, `description`, `extracted_content`, `upload_timestamp`

#### **Response to Frontend**  
- Return a confirmation with the `document_id` and metadata.

## **2. Document Categorization with Gemini**

### **Backend Categorization Module**  
1. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Convert the uploaded file into a compatible format (e.g., text extraction from PDF).  
   - Split large documents into smaller chunks to improve processing efficiency (use chunking for documents over 200 pages).

2. **Gemini Document Understanding API:**  
   - Analyze the file to categorize it as either a **business rule set** or **data table**:
     - **Business Rule Set:** Text-heavy documents with instructions, compliance rules, or policies.
     - **Data Table:** Structured content such as tabular data, forms, or records.

3. **Branching Based on Categorization:**  
   - **If Business Rule Set:**  
     - Store the file in the `uploaded_ruleset` table with metadata.
   - **If Data Table:**  
     - Extract content using Gemini’s **Extraction API**.
     - Convert the extracted data into a **flat JSON structure**.
     - Store the extracted content in the `uploaded_data` table.

4. **Error Handling:**  
   - If the file cannot be categorized (e.g., due to unclear structure), log the error and:
     - Optionally notify the user and ask them to manually categorize the document.
     - Provide fallback options to upload as a general document.

---

## **3. Chat Interface**

### **Frontend**  
1. **Document Selection:**  
   - The chatbot interface allows users to select from a list of previously uploaded files, fetched from the database.  
   - Each file in the list shows the name and description for easier identification.

2. **File Loading:**  
   - Once a document is selected, the frontend requests the backend to retrieve the file or its extracted content.

---

### **4. Data Retrieval**

#### **For Business Rule Sets (Small Files)**  
1. Query the `uploaded_ruleset` table to get the `file_location`.  
2. Retrieve the file from object storage (e.g., AWS S3).  
3. Load the file content into the **chat service cache** if cached context is supported.

#### **For Data Tables (Small Files)**  
1. Query the `uploaded_data` table for the `extracted_content` (flat JSON).
2. Load the JSON content into the **chat service cache**.

---

### **For Larger Documents (> 200 pages)**  
1. **Without Cached Context:**
   - For **Business Rule Sets:**
     - The file is retrieved from object storage directly.
     - Parsing and interaction are done dynamically with the Gemini **Document Understanding API** during each user query.
   - For **Data Tables:**
     - The extracted data (flat JSON) is retrieved from the database.
     - The chatbot queries the data on-the-fly, without caching large portions of the document in memory.

2. **With Cached Context (Optional):**
   - If the document size is manageable (≤ 200 pages):
     - The entire document content is cached, allowing for faster interactions by retrieving context from memory.
     - Follow-up queries within the same session are handled using the cached data.

---

## **5. Chat Service with Gemini Document Processing**

### **Caching (Optional)**  
- **For smaller files or rule sets:**  
   - Cache the entire document content in a session-specific cache (e.g., Redis or in-memory storage).
   - Allow **cached context** to power real-time interactions.
- **For larger files (over 200 pages):**  
   - Use **dynamic processing** where each query triggers parsing of the relevant sections of the document. This avoids memory overload and provides more scalability.
   - Responses from Gemini Document Understanding API are parsed and returned as needed.

### **User Interaction:**  
1. **For Rule Sets:**  
   - The Gemini Document Understanding API dynamically retrieves relevant sections for specific queries.
   - **Examples of queries:**
     - “What is the compliance deadline for this policy?”
     - “Where does the document mention audits?”

2. **For Data Tables:**  
   - The chatbot queries the **extracted JSON data** directly for specific data points.
   - **Examples of queries:**
     - “Show me all records with sales above $10,000.”
     - “Give me the highest revenue from this year.”

### **Context Awareness:**  
- Maintain session-based context for follow-up queries.
- If the document is large and not cached, provide responses by querying the document as needed.

---

## **6. Feedback and Validation**

### **User Feedback Module**  
1. After interacting with the document, users can:
   - **Categorization Feedback:**  
     - If the document was misclassified (e.g., a rule set identified as a data file), users can manually re-categorize it.
   - **Data Extraction Feedback:**  
     - Flag any missing or incorrect data in extracted content.
   - Use feedback to improve processing models (e.g., improve categorization accuracy).

---

## **7. File Management**

### **Backend File Management**  
1. **Storage Optimization:**  
   - **Lifecycle Policies:** Automatically move files to archive if not accessed after a set period (e.g., 1 year).
   - **File Access:**  
     - For rule sets, maintain the files in long-term storage.
     - For data files, store the extracted content in the database and archive the raw files if not needed for active use.

2. **File Deletion and Cleanup:**  
   - Files can be deleted or archived based on lifecycle rules or user requests.
   - File deletion updates both object storage and metadata in the database.

---

## **8. Scalability and Performance**

### **Handling Large Files:**  
1. **Chunking:**  
   - For documents over 200 pages, **chunk the document** into smaller sections for more manageable processing.
   - Process each chunk separately when needed, ensuring only relevant content is loaded at any time.

2. **Asynchronous Processing:**  
   - Use an asynchronous task queue (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ) for background processing of file uploads, document categorization, and extraction.

3. **Cache Eviction Policies:**  
   - Implement policies for eviction and expiration of cached documents, especially for large files, to ensure memory is efficiently used.

## **9. Technologies and Tools**

### **Frontend:**  
- **Frameworks:** React.js or Vue.js  
- **Chatbot Framework:** Dialogflow or Rasa  

### **Backend:**  
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB  
- **Storage:** AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage  
- **Task Queue:** Celery or AWS Step Functions  

### **Gemini Integration:**

### **Monitoring and Logging:**  
- **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus, Datadog, ELK Stack  

---

### **Final Flow Summary**

- **File Upload & Categorization:** Files are uploaded and categorized as either **business rules** or **data tables**.  
- **Dynamic Processing:** Large files (>200 pages) avoid cached context; instead, they are dynamically processed as needed.
- **User Interaction:** Users can query documents with or without cached context, depending on the document size.
- **File Management:** Object storage with lifecycle policies ensures cost-efficient long-term storage.  
- **Scalability:** Large files are processed in chunks, ensuring efficient memory and resource usage.
